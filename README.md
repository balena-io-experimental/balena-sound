# IoTSound

**Starter project enabling you to add multi-room audio streaming via Bluetooth, Airplay2, Spotify Connect and others to any old speakers or Hi-Fi using just a Raspberry Pi.**

IoTSound, formerly balenaSound, was developed in 2019 to showcase the capabilities of the [balena IoT platform](https://www.balena.io/) which provides powerful edge device management at scale. Unfortunately, balenaSound has not connected with its intended audience: the commercial and industrial IoT space where the balena platform has thrived. Rather than archive and discontinue balenaSound, we are separating it from balena and gifting it to the hobbyist audio community that has been so passionate about it over the past years. 

If you would like to become a maintainer of this project, please reach out to us in the [call for maintainers](https://github.com/iotsound/iotsound/issues/689) issue open now!

## Motivation

![concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotsound/iotsound/master/docs/images/sound.png)

There are many commercial solutions out there that provide functionality similar to IoTSound. Most of them though come with a premium price tag and are riddled with privacy concerns.

IoTSound is an open source project that allows you to build your own DIY audio streaming platform without compromises. Why spend big money on hardware that might be deemed obsolete by the vendor as they see fit? With IoTSound you are in control, bring your old speakers back to life!

This project is no longer in active development but if you'd like to be a maintainer please submit an issue here on GitHub.
