How can I theme/configure my Landr website?
-------------------------------------------

The Landr team believes in a zero configuration approach. We think Landr should
be able to determine what you have and how to present it in the best possible
way. We know this is a very ambitious goal, and if you think something is off,
[reach out to us](https://github.com/balena-io/landr/issues/new)! Whatever you
have in mind, we can try to teach Landr about it, which benefits the community
more than adding a configuration flag.

Can I extend my Landr website with a page I fully control?
----------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Landr generates static HTML, CSS, and JS. You can add more files to the
bundle as you wish before pushing them to Netlify.

Why is Landr using Netlify instead of GitHub Pages?
---------------------------------------------------

Netlify can do everything that GitHub Pages can do, and it also provides some
extra features and flexibility that we find really valuable for Landr, such as
being able to deploy more than one branch of a site at the same time, A/B
testing, form submissions management, and more. On top all of that, Netlify is free to use!
