  ## Usage instructions


  **Application download**

  Once you power up your device you'll need to allow some time for it to
  download the application, this typically takes 5-10 minutes but it can take
  more depending on your internet connection and what device you are using.


  **Usage**

  When the download is completed the application will start. You should see a
  balenaSound broadcasted as a speaker on your bluetooth, Airplay and Spotify
  Connect streaming services. You can also access http://balena or
  http://balena.local to access balenaSound's control panel.
