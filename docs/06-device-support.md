# Device support

## Recommended

balenaSound has been developed and tested to work on the following devices:

| Device Type                                   | Default mode | Standalone mode (`STANDALONE`) | Multi-room mode (`MULTI_ROOM`) | Multi-room client mode (`MULTI_ROOM_CLIENT`) |

**Notes**

[1]: We recommend using a DAC or USB sound card for these device types. See [audio interfaces](audio-interfaces) for more details.

[2]: Multi-room `master` functionality is disabled on Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 family devices due to performance constraints. They can however function in multi-room client mode in conjunction with another device that supports multi-room mode. Read more about modes of operation [here](usage#modes-of-operation).

[3]: There is a known issue where on the 64 bit version of balenaOS no output is coming through the audio jack/hdmi. See troubleshooting section [here](https://balena-labs-projects.github.io/balena-sound/usage#modes-of-operation/support#troubleshooting) (Scroll down to `No audio when using balenaOS 64 bit on Raspberry Pi 3's`)

[4]: There is a [known issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1444) with all variants of the Raspberry Pi 3 where Bluetooth and WiFi interfere with each other. This will only impact the performance of balenaSound if you use a **Pi 3 as the master server to do multi-room bluetooth streaming**, resulting in stuttering audio (Airplay and Spotify Connect will work fine, as well as all streaming methods with multi-room disabled). In this cases we recommend the use of a Raspberry Pi 4 as the `master` server or a Pi 3 with a bluetooth dongle.

## Experimental

Devices with experimental support **have been tested to work**, though we have found compelling reasons for not including them as first-class citizens of balenaSound. If you are shopping for parts, we do not recommend you buy a device from this list.

Some of the reasons we've flagged devices as experimental include:

- device requires multiple extra hardware pieces (USB dongles, adapters, etc)
- device has known bugs that prevent some features to work properly and the timeline for a fix is not clear
