# Getting started

Getting started with balenaSound is as simple as deploying it to a [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) application; no additional configuration is required (unless you're using a DAC HAT).
We've outlined the installation steps below. If you want a step-by-step tutorial on how to get balenaSound up and running, feel free to check these blog posts:
- [Turn your old speakers or Hi-Fi into Bluetooth, Airplay and Spotify receivers with a Raspberry Pi and this step-by-step guide](https://www.balena.io/blog/turn-your-old-speakers-or-hi-fi-into-bluetooth-receivers-using-only-a-raspberry-pi/)

## Hardware required
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/master/images/hardware.jpeg)

* Raspberry Pi 3A+/3B/3B+/4B/Zero W
* SD Card (we recommend 8GB Sandisk Extreme Pro)
* Power supply
* 3.5mm audio cable to the input on your speakers/Hi-Fi (usually 3.5mm or RCA). Alternatively you can use the HDMI port to get digital audio out.

**Notes** 
- The Raspberry Pi Zero cannot be used on it's own as it has no audio output. To use the Pi Zero, you'll need to add something like the [Pimoroni pHAT DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/phat-dac) (out of stock and going to be replaced, see [#111](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/issues/111)) to go with it.
- For an extended list of device types supported please check this [link](../supported-devices).


## Software required

* A download of this project (of course)
* Software to flash an SD card ([balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher))
* A free [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) account
* The [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## Provision your device

* Sign up for or login to the [balenaCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com)
* Create an application, selecting the correct device type for your Raspberry Pi (we recommend setting the type as Raspberry Pi 1/Zero as your application will then be compatible with the Pi 1/Zero as well as all devices that were released afterward).
* Add a device to the application, enabling you to download the OS
* Flash the downloaded OS to your SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)
* Power up the Pi and check it's online in the dashboard

## Deploy the application

* Install the [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
* Login with `balena login`
* Download this project and from the project directory run `balena push <appName>` where `<appName>` is the name you gave your balenaCloud application in the first step.
